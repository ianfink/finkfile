finkfile is a character pseudo device driver that implements a file
that behaves like a circular queue.

Currently, this is a work-in-progress.  There are various areas of the
program instructions that are utilized for debugging purposes and will
be taken out at a later date.  Nevertheless, it does work if you
want to have a go at it.

TODO:

(1)  Finish testing
(2)  Remove debugging program instructions
(3)  Add support for kqueue (e.g., so "tail -f" will work properly)
